# getDisplayMedia() Demo

This demo uses `getDisplayMedia()` and the `Media Stream Recording API` to record the screen, your microphone & system sounds on Chrome.

Works on:
* Chrome 74 and up

Limitations:
* The user needs to opt in to sharing system sounds in the Chrome screen sharing dialog
* On Chrome for macOS & Linux it is only possible to share your audio when choosing to capture a Chrome tab
* Firefox does not yet support capturing for system sounds
