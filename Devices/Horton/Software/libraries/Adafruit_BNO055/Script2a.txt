Script 2: 6 dropshipping technology things you have to get right

Hi, I’m Frank Cohen, a Silicon Valley technology guy. This is a class where I show you the technology behind the scenes that the dropshipping masters use to be successful.

Dropshipping is an order fulfillment method that does not require a business to keep products in stock. Instead, your store sells the product, and passes on the sales order to a third-party supplier, who then ships the order to your customer.

Every dropshipper goes through these 6 steps and each needs you to find and make technology choices.

Step #1
It’s rare to find someone who can set-up an entire dropshipping business without some sort of assistance. I recommend you find a mentor or a community to answer your inevitable “How do I do this?” questions. Even the dropshipping mentors need mentors. For example, Anton Kraly is a dropshipping master and yet he’s not so strong on using Square to set-up your shop, nor upgrading to bank payment processors to keep your money in your pocket. I recommend you find a mentor  that matches up with your own style. I like 3 places to find mentors: a) https://www.growthmentor.com/, b) https://www.tenthousandcoffees.com, and https://www.meetup.com/. Then consider buying the mentor’s available courses. Look for the course that will help you get to customer’s placing orders in your store fastest.

Step #2
Everyone finds their own style. Everyone starts at zero. You can find your style by asking questions. When you join my free Facebook group I’ll introduce you to my drop shipping master friends for free, you ask questions and get immediate answers. For example, you may ask if spending an extra $60 to $200 on a custom store theme from Themeforest and Templatemonster is worth it.
