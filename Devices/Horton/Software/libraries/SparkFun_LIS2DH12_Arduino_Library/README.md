SparkFun LIS2DH12 Arduino Library
===========================================================

![SparkFun Qwiic LIS2DH12](https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/4/3/5/5/15760-Triple_Axis_Accelerometer_Breakout_-_LIS2DH12__Qwiic_-01.jpg)

[*SparkFun Qwiic LIS2DH12 Accelerometer (DEV-15760)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15760)

A simple to use I2C library for the very low power LIS2DH12 from ST.

This library can be installed via the Arduino Library manager. Search for **SparkFun LIS2DH12**. ST offers a great portable C library for the LIS2DH12. This library just wraps that library making it Arduino friendly and easier to use with lots of examples.

Want to help? Please do! We are always looking for ways to improve and build out features of this library.

* This library currently only supports I2C but could be expanded to use SPI as well.
