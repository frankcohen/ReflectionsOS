Reflections, distributed entertainment device

What started as a project to wear videos of my children as they grew up on my
arm as a wristwatch, grew to be a platform for making entertaining experiences.
This is the software component. It runs on an ESP32-based platform with OLED display,
audio player, flash memory, GPS, gesture sensor, and accelerometer/compass

Repository is at https://github.com/frankcohen/ReflectionsOS
Includes board wiring directions, server side components, examples, support
