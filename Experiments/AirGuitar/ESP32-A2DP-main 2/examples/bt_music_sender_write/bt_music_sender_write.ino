/*
  Streaming of sound data with Bluetooth to an other Bluetooth device.
  We provide the complete sound data as a simple c array which 
  can be prepared e.g. in the following way

  - Open any sound file in Audacity. Make sure that it contains 2 channels
    - Select Tracks -> Resample and select 44100
    - Export -> Export Audio -> Header Raw ; Signed 16 bit PCM
  - Convert to c file e.g. with "xxd -i file_example_WAV_1MG.raw file_example_WAV_1MG.c"
    - add the const qualifier to the array definition. E.g const unsigned char file_example_WAV_1MG_raw[] = {
