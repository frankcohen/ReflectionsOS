Script 6 - Instant retargeting technology - get customers to convert again
Each digital ad network has really limited target options to get your ad in front of people interested in your product. For example, if I’m marketing a skin care product for women in their 40’s who have rosacea - it’s a skin condition, Facebook custom audiences won’t let me target to rosacea. Ugh!

With Clever Moe I enter the link to my product page and Clever Moe finds the audiences on Facebook automatically.. Plus it finds audiences on Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Instagram.

I set the schedule, I set the ads, and click launch. Clever Moe uses your ad account to set-up and run your ad. The ad appears like a normal Facebook ad and I can make whatever tweaks I want to the campaign directly.

You’ve seen inconsistent ad performance, like ads being all over the place. With Clever Moe I have a single dashboard to let me see and compare all the results.

Clever Moe has its own Tracking Pixel. It’s a first for the whole industry… it is a single pixel to work across all the ad networks. Now I don’t have to guess my Return On Ad Spend (ROAS), I can see it right here. Clicks, landing on my site, and conversion, it’s all here.

Retargeting couldn’t be easier. I click clone on a campaign and launch a new ad with new messaging to my targets. I don’t need to import or create custom audiences as Clever Moe has already done the targeting for me. And if I want to use Facebook or Twitter lookalike audiences or other targeting I do that with the campaigns Clever Moe has so quickly and automatically set up for me.

This software is going to save you a ton of time and money. And, It will allow you to grow your dropshipping business as you advertise to all digital ad networks and add on more products.
