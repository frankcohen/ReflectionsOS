Arduino-based Internet enabled watch project and reference architecture to make your own projects

Many times I imagine making a mobile application connected to the Internet. For example, a wrist watch. I love the Arduino community and yet when I go to put something like this together I find many tutorials on the parts (like a display, bluetooth, SD card, sound, and compass) there's very little I found that shows them all integrated together. I am making my watch project and will be posting the code, datasheets, and design in the Reflections repository.

I love working with a group of creative makers. Please feel free to let me know your feedback and ideas. Thanks, in advance!
