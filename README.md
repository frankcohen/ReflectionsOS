# ReflectionsOS
ESP32 and Arduino-based Internet enabled watch project and reference architecture to make your own projects

![Reflections Mobile Experiences](Reflections_logo.jpg)

Many times I imagine making a mobile application connected to the Internet. For example, a wrist watch. I love the Arduino community and yet when I go to put something like this together I find many tutorials on the parts (like a display, bluetooth, SD card, sound, and compass) there's very little I found that shows them integrated together. I am making my watch project and will be posting the code, datasheets, and design in the Reflections repository.

I love working with a group of creative makers. Please feel free to let me know your feedback and ideas. Thanks, in advance!

EasyEDA project for the main board project is at:

The wrist watch is a way for me to enjoy home videos of my children on my wrist - my Reflections project. I published 3 articles on the technology needed to make Reflections:

I used the EleksTube IPS clock for experimentation. It is an ESP32 device featuring 6 TFT displays. See

Update as of March 16, 2023:

Horton board is in from assembly and it works great! Next up, our first wearable prototype.
Expect many updates to the source code repository over the coming weeks and months.


Update as of January 25, 2023:

All of the main board components are working. One more revision of the board is needed to incorporate the reworks we made to the ThingTwo board. We're calling the new revision Horton. It should be complete and go to manufacture and assembly in early February 2023.

The project team attention next goes to producing the first wearable prototype. This will strap to one's wrist, run on battery, and have a prototype display. We are also considering our first crowd funding campaign featuring the prototype. This is leading to an exciting Spring 2023.


Update as of July 30, 2022:

We're making great progress on the main board, animation, and software projects. Main board revision 2 - codenamed Hoober - works and displays streaming video at 10 Frames Per Second (FPS). Revision 3 - codenamed ThingTwo - is designed and will go to manufacturing and assembly next week. See Devices/ThingTwo for design document, Gerber files, BOM, and wiring guide. Project focus will move to the software projects.

Update as of April 27, 2022:

The project team is making progress on the main board and display. We received the first assembled main board in hand. Itâ€™s an ESP32 with GPS, IMU/compass, NAND memory, TFT display, audio output, USB, battery management, and finger gesture sensor, in a 34 mm round board. Cost for the prototype is $70 per board. This first version has about 3-4 problems that need reworking. The team is feeling good that the number of problems is less than 10. That puts us on track to have the finished board in Summer 2022. I will put the Gerber files and BOM into the repository for the upcoming revision 2 - code named Hoober. I am glad to send the Gerber files for your review, criticism, and feedback.
