==========================

Example Briefs
--------------

* ADCUsage - Demonstrates analog in reads and has notes about temperature collection
* FifoExample - Demonstrates using the built-in buffer to burst-collect data - **Good demonstration of settings**
* FullSettingExample - Shows all settings, with non-used options commented out
* IntUsage - shows configuration of interrupt bits
* LowLevelExample - Demonstrates using only the core driver without math and settings overhead
* MinimalistExample - The **easiest** configuration
* MultiI2C - Using two LIS3DHs over I2C
* MultiSPI - Using two LIS3DHs over SPI
