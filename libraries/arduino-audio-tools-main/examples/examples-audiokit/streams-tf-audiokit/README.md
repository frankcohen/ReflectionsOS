## Using the AI Thinker ESP32 with Tensoflow Lite to Generate Audio

I found some cheap [AI Thinker ESP32 Audio Kit V2.2](https://docs.ai-thinker.com/en/esp32-audio-kit) on AliExpress and because I was tired of all the wires I had to connect to implement my different scenarios that are possible with my [Arduino Audio Tools Library](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools), I thought it to be a good idea to buy this board. You dont need to bother about any wires because everything is on one nice board. Just just need to install the dependencies.

The starting point is the good overview provided by [the "Hallo World" example of Tensorflow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers/get_started_low_level#train_a_model) which describes how to create, train and use a model which based on the __sine function__. Further information can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools/wiki/Tensorflow-Lite----Audio-Output/_edit)
