Reflections is a hardware, software, and server architecture for building mobile entertaining experiences. This is the software repository.

- ReflectionsOS - is the stable production version of the code. It is largely for the Cheshire Cat project at [Starling Watch](https://starlingwatch.com). 

- ReflectionsOSdev - this is the experimental version. New features and bug fixes appear here before moving into ReflectionsOS. It took 3 years to develop. Now that the Cheshire Cat is alive we will revisit the production code to make it work for your application.

- AccelerometerLab - a utility to understand the LIS3DH inexpensive 3 Axis accelerometer component. It senses movement
and acceleration from gravity.

- MakerFaire2024Maxwell - a fun Magic 8 Ball experience for the Maker Faire Bay Area built with the ReflectionsOS project. It was October 18 to 20, 2024 on Mar Island in the California Bay area and 25,000 people attended. [Watch a video on the experience](https://youtube.com/shorts/2h5V32wpsNU?feature=share)
